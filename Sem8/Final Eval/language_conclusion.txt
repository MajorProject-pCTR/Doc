	On a subset of the original dataset we implemented some basic machine learning algorithms using the languages Octave, Python, R and Vowpal Wabbit. It was found that the results of R and Octave were significantly better. R also has inbuilt functions for various ML algos. Hence it is easier to usethan Octave. Also the popularity of R in data science competions is high and is increasing [1]. On the other hand, Vowpal Wabbit has the advantage that its algorithms are out of core and hence primary memory imposes no restrictions on it.
